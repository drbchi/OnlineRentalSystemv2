      <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to the Terms and Conditions page for our Services, which governs your use of our website, mobile applications, and any other platforms or services we provide, collectively referred to as the "Services." By accessing or using our Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions, along with our Privacy Policy, which is incorporated herein by reference, and we strongly recommend that you read this document carefully to understand your rights, obligations, and the rules that apply to your engagement with our platform, as these terms form a legally binding agreement between you and us, ensuring a fair and transparent relationship as you utilize our features, interact with our content, and benefit from the tools and resources we offer. These Terms apply to all users, whether you are a registered account holder, a guest browsing our website, or a third party accessing our Services through an integrated feature, and they are designed to protect both you and us by setting clear expectations, outlining acceptable use, and detailing the consequences of non-compliance, while also ensuring compliance with applicable laws and regulations across various jurisdictions, including but not limited to consumer protection laws, intellectual property laws, and digital service regulations, so you can use our Services with confidence, knowing that we are committed to maintaining a professional, secure, and user-friendly environment for everyone involved.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>1. Acceptance of Terms</strong><br>
        By accessing or using our Services in any manner, whether by creating an account, browsing our website, downloading our mobile app, or engaging with any feature, content, or functionality we provide, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions in their entirety, as well as any additional policies, guidelines, or rules we may post on our platform from time to time, such as our Privacy Policy, community guidelines, or specific terms for promotions, which are incorporated into these Terms by reference, forming a comprehensive legal agreement that governs your relationship with us and ensures that all interactions on our platform are conducted fairly and responsibly. If you do not agree with any part of these Terms, you must immediately cease using our Services, as continued use will be considered your acceptance of these Terms, and if you are accessing our Services on behalf of a business, organization, or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that entity to these Terms, in which case “you” and “your” will refer to that entity, and you agree to be responsible for ensuring that all users associated with that entity comply with these Terms, thereby preventing any unauthorized or improper use that could harm our platform or other users. We reserve the right to modify, amend, or update these Terms at our sole discretion, and we will notify you of significant changes by posting the revised Terms on our website, sending an email to your registered email address, or displaying an in-app notification, and such changes will take effect immediately upon posting unless otherwise stated, with your continued use of the Services after such changes signifying your acceptance of the updated Terms, so we encourage you to review this page periodically to stay informed of any updates that may affect your rights or obligations while using our platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>2. Eligibility</strong><br>
        To use our Services, you must meet certain eligibility criteria designed to ensure that our platform is used responsibly and in compliance with applicable laws, and by accessing or using our Services, you represent and warrant that you are at least 18 years of age (or the age of majority in your jurisdiction, if higher), and if you are between the ages of 13 and 18 (or the applicable age of majority), you may only use our Services under the supervision and with the express consent of a parent or legal guardian who agrees to be bound by these Terms on your behalf, as we do not permit children under 13 (or 16 in the European Economic Area) to use our Services under any circumstances due to legal restrictions such as the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) in the United States and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the EU, which impose strict requirements on the collection and use of children’s data. Additionally, you must not be barred from using our Services under any applicable law, regulation, or court order, nor may you be located in a country that is subject to a U.S. government embargo or designated as a “terrorist-supporting” country by the U.S. government, such as those listed on the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctions list, and you must not be listed on any U.S. government list of prohibited or restricted parties, such as the Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list, ensuring that our Services are not accessed by individuals or entities that could pose a legal or security risk to our platform or its users. If we determine, at our sole discretion, that you do not meet these eligibility requirements, we reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to our Services without prior notice, and you agree to provide accurate and up-to-date information during registration or when requested, as any misrepresentation of your eligibility may result in immediate account termination and potential legal action, depending on the nature and severity of the violation, so we can maintain a safe and compliant environment for all users.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>3. Account Registration and Security</strong><br>
        To access certain features of our Services, such as personalized content, premium features, or the ability to make purchases, you may be required to create an account by providing accurate, current, and complete information as prompted during the registration process, including but not limited to your full name, email address, phone number, and a secure password, and you agree to keep this information updated at all times to ensure that we can contact you if necessary and that your account remains secure and accessible, as failure to provide accurate information may result in suspension or termination of your account at our discretion, especially if we suspect fraudulent activity or misuse. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials, including your password, and for all activities that occur under your account, whether or not authorized by you, meaning you must immediately notify us at privacy@casalux.com if you suspect any unauthorized access or use of your account, such as unusual login activity, unrecognized transactions, or changes to your profile that you did not initiate, so we can take appropriate action to secure your account, which may include resetting your password, suspending your account temporarily, or conducting an investigation to determine the extent of the breach and prevent further unauthorized access. You agree not to share your account credentials with any third party, use your account for any unlawful purpose, or allow others to access your account, as doing so may compromise the security of your data and our platform, and we will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with these security obligations, including but not limited to unauthorized transactions, data breaches, or loss of access to your account, though we will make reasonable efforts to assist you in recovering your account if possible, provided you cooperate fully with our security team and provide any requested information to verify your identity and resolve the issue.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>4. Use of Services</strong><br>
        We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to access and use our Services for personal, non-commercial purposes, subject to your compliance with these Terms, meaning you may use our website, mobile app, and related features to browse content, engage with our tools, make purchases, or interact with other users as permitted, but you are strictly prohibited from using our Services for any unlawful, unauthorized, or prohibited activities, such as distributing malware, engaging in hacking or phishing attempts, posting defamatory or obscene content, or using our platform to promote illegal activities, as such actions will result in immediate termination of your access and may lead to legal action depending on the severity of the violation and applicable laws in your jurisdiction. You agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell, or exploit any portion of our Services, including our software, content, design, or user interface, without our express written permission, nor may you attempt to reverse-engineer, decompile, or disassemble any part of our Services, as doing so violates our intellectual property rights and may expose you to civil and criminal liability under laws like the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) or similar regulations in other jurisdictions. Additionally, you must not use automated systems, such as bots, scripts, or spiders, to access, scrape, or harvest data from our Services, nor may you engage in any activity that interferes with or disrupts the functionality of our platform, such as launching denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, overloading our servers, or attempting to bypass our security measures, as such actions compromise the integrity of our Services and the experience of other users, and we reserve the right to monitor your activity, investigate any suspected violations, and take appropriate action, including suspending or terminating your access, reporting illegal activities to law enforcement, and seeking damages for any harm caused to our platform or users as a result of your actions.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>5. User Content</strong><br>
        Our Services may allow you to submit, post, upload, or otherwise make available content, such as comments, reviews, photos, videos, or other materials, collectively referred to as "User Content," and by doing so, you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, distribute, and display such User Content in connection with operating, promoting, and improving our Services, including using your content in marketing materials, social media posts, or other promotional activities, without any compensation to you, though we will strive to attribute your content to you where appropriate and feasible, such as by displaying your username alongside your review or comment. You represent and warrant that you own or have the necessary rights, licenses, consents, and permissions to submit your User Content and grant us the license described above, and that your User Content does not infringe, misappropriate, or violate any third-party rights, including intellectual property rights, privacy rights, or publicity rights, nor does it contain any unlawful, defamatory, obscene, or otherwise objectionable material, as determined by us in our sole discretion, and you agree to indemnify us against any claims, damages, or liabilities arising from your User Content, including legal fees and costs associated with defending against such claims. We reserve the right, but are not obligated, to monitor, review, edit, or remove any User Content at any time for any reason, including if we believe it violates these Terms, our community guidelines, or applicable laws, such as content that promotes hate speech, violence, or discrimination, and we may suspend or terminate your account if you repeatedly submit inappropriate content, ensuring that our platform remains a safe, respectful, and inclusive space for all users to engage and interact without fear of harassment or exposure to harmful material.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>6. Intellectual Property</strong><br>
        All content, materials, and elements of our Services, including but not limited to text, graphics, logos, icons, images, audio clips, video clips, software, code, user interfaces, and the overall design and layout of our website and mobile app, collectively referred to as "Our Content," are owned by us or our licensors and are protected by copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, and other intellectual property laws, both in the United States and internationally, meaning you may not copy, reproduce, distribute, modify, create derivative works of, publicly display, or otherwise use Our Content without our prior written consent, except as expressly permitted under these Terms, such as using Our Content for personal, non-commercial purposes in the manner intended by our Services, like viewing articles, downloading permitted resources, or sharing links to our content as allowed by our features. We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to access and use Our Content solely for your personal, non-commercial use in connection with our Services, and you agree not to remove, alter, or obscure any copyright, trademark, or other proprietary rights notices included in Our Content, nor may you use our trademarks, logos, or brand elements in a way that suggests endorsement, affiliation, or sponsorship without our express written permission, as doing so may lead to legal action to protect our intellectual property rights, including seeking injunctive relief and damages for any unauthorized use. If you believe that any content on our Services infringes your intellectual property rights, such as a copyrighted image or trademarked logo used without permission, please contact us at privacy@casalux.com with a detailed notice that includes the specific content in question, proof of your ownership or rights, and your contact information, and we will investigate the matter promptly in accordance with applicable laws like the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), taking appropriate action such as removing the infringing content or providing a counter-notice process if applicable, ensuring that intellectual property rights are respected and protected on our platform for all parties involved.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>7. Payments and Subscriptions</strong><br>
        Certain features of our Services, such as premium content, advanced tools, or ad-free experiences, may require payment or a subscription, and by making a purchase or subscribing, you agree to provide accurate and complete payment information, such as your credit card details, billing address, and contact information, and you authorize us and our third-party payment processors to charge your payment method for the applicable fees, including any recurring subscription fees, taxes, and additional charges as outlined at the time of purchase, ensuring that we can process your payment efficiently and securely while complying with payment industry standards like PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard). All fees are non-refundable except as required by law or as specified in our refund policy, which may allow for refunds in cases of technical errors, unauthorized charges, or failure to deliver the purchased service, and you agree to review the pricing, payment terms, and refund policy before completing your purchase, as these terms will govern your transaction and any disputes that may arise, such as issues with billing errors or subscription cancellations, which you can address by contacting us at privacy@casalux.com for assistance. For recurring subscriptions, we will automatically renew your subscription at the end of each billing cycle (e.g., monthly or annually) using the payment method on file, unless you cancel your subscription prior to the renewal date through your account settings or by contacting us, and we will notify you in advance of each renewal with the updated fees and terms, giving you the opportunity to cancel if you no longer wish to continue, while failure to pay any fees due may result in suspension or termination of your access to the paid features, though we will make reasonable efforts to notify you of payment issues and provide a grace period to resolve them before taking such actions, ensuring a fair and transparent payment process for all users.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>8. Termination</strong><br>
        We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to our Services, in whole or in part, at our sole discretion, with or without notice, for any reason, including but not limited to your violation of these Terms, such as engaging in prohibited activities like hacking, posting illegal content, or repeatedly submitting inappropriate User Content, as well as for other reasons like failure to pay subscription fees, suspected fraudulent activity, or if we believe your actions pose a risk to the security, integrity, or reputation of our platform, other users, or third parties, and upon termination, your license to use our Services will immediately cease, meaning you must stop accessing or using any features, content, or tools provided by our platform, and we may delete your account and any associated data, including your User Content, subject to our data retention policies as outlined in our Privacy Policy. You may also terminate your account at any time by following the instructions in your account settings or by contacting us at privacy@casalux.com, and upon your voluntary termination, we will deactivate your account and remove your personal information within 30 days, barring any legal obligations to retain certain data, such as transaction records for tax purposes, and you acknowledge that termination will result in the loss of access to any paid features, subscriptions, or content associated with your account, with no refunds provided unless required by law or our refund policy. Termination does not relieve you of any obligations incurred prior to termination, such as outstanding payment obligations or liability for violations of these Terms, and provisions of these Terms that by their nature should survive termination, such as intellectual property, limitation of liability, and dispute resolution clauses, will remain in effect, ensuring that both parties’ rights and responsibilities are upheld even after your relationship with our Services ends, maintaining clarity and fairness in all circumstances.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>9. Disclaimers</strong><br>
        Our Services are provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis, without any warranties of any kind, either express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, or that our Services will be uninterrupted, error-free, or free of viruses or other harmful components, as we cannot guarantee that our platform will always function perfectly due to factors beyond our control, such as internet outages, server failures, or cyberattacks, and you agree to use our Services at your own risk, understanding that we disclaim any liability for issues arising from such limitations, such as data loss, service interruptions, or inaccuracies in content, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. We do not warrant the accuracy, completeness, or reliability of any content or information provided through our Services, including third-party content, user-generated content, or links to external websites, and you acknowledge that any reliance on such content or information is at your own discretion, meaning we will not be liable for any damages or losses resulting from your use of or reliance on our Services, such as financial losses from decisions based on inaccurate data, emotional distress from exposure to objectionable content, or technical issues that prevent you from accessing our platform during critical moments, as these risks are inherent in using online services. While we strive to maintain a high standard of service, we may change, suspend, or discontinue any part of our Services at any time without notice, such as updating features, removing outdated functionalities, or temporarily halting access for maintenance, and we will not be liable for any resulting inconvenience, loss of data, or interruption to your use, ensuring that you understand the limitations of our liability and the scope of our responsibilities as a service provider operating in a dynamic digital environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>10. Limitation of Liability</strong><br>
        To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, we, our affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, and licensors will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including but not limited to loss of profits, revenue, data, goodwill, or use, or any other intangible losses, arising out of or relating to your use of our Services, whether based on contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or any other legal theory, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages, meaning that if you experience issues like financial losses due to a service interruption, emotional distress from user interactions, or data loss from a security breach, we will not be responsible for compensating you for those losses beyond what is required by law, as this limitation helps us manage the risks associated with operating a digital platform that serves a diverse global user base. Our total aggregate liability for any claims arising out of or relating to these Terms or your use of our Services will not exceed the greater of the amount you paid us for the Services in the preceding 12 months or $100, whichever is higher, ensuring that our liability is capped at a reasonable amount that reflects the value of your engagement with our platform, while certain jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain damages, such as for gross negligence or intentional misconduct, so this limitation may not apply to you in those cases, and you may have additional rights under local laws, such as consumer protection statutes, that cannot be waived. You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from any claims, damages, or liabilities arising from your use of our Services in violation of these Terms, including any legal fees or costs we incur in defending against such claims, ensuring that you take responsibility for your actions and that we are protected from liability caused by your misuse of our platform or non-compliance with these Terms, maintaining a balanced and fair approach to liability for all parties involved.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>11. Dispute Resolution</strong><br>
        Any disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or your use of our Services will be resolved through binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify, and this arbitration agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), ensuring a fair, efficient, and cost-effective process for resolving disputes outside of the traditional court system, which can often be lengthy and expensive for both parties. Arbitration will be conducted by a single neutral arbitrator under the rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA), including its Consumer Arbitration Rules, which provide a structured framework for the proceedings, and the arbitration will take place in a location mutually agreed upon by both parties, or if no agreement is reached, in a location determined by the AAA, with the proceedings conducted in English, and you waive any right to a jury trial or to participate in a class action lawsuit, meaning disputes will be resolved on an individual basis rather than as part of a collective action, which helps streamline the process and reduce legal costs. The arbitrator’s decision will be final and binding, except for limited rights of appeal under the FAA, and the arbitrator may award any relief that a court could award, including monetary damages, injunctive relief, or attorneys’ fees, but before initiating arbitration, you agree to first attempt to resolve the dispute informally by contacting us at privacy@casalux.com with a detailed description of your issue, and we will work with you in good faith to resolve the matter within 30 days, as this informal resolution process can often address concerns quickly without the need for formal proceedings, fostering a cooperative approach to dispute resolution that benefits both parties. If the arbitration provision is found to be unenforceable, or if you opt out of arbitration by sending us written notice within 30 days of accepting these Terms, disputes will be resolved in the federal or state courts located in [Insert Jurisdiction], and you consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of those courts, ensuring a clear legal framework for resolving disputes while protecting both your rights and ours in the event of a disagreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>12. Governing Law</strong><br>
        These Terms and your use of our Services will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of [Insert State], United States, without regard to its conflict of law principles, meaning that any legal disputes, interpretations, or issues arising from these Terms will be resolved using the laws of this jurisdiction, providing a consistent legal framework for all users regardless of their location, while if any provision of these Terms is found to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable by a court or arbitrator, that provision will be deemed severable from the rest of these Terms and will not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining provisions, ensuring that the overall agreement remains intact and enforceable even if specific clauses are challenged or invalidated. This choice of law does not deprive you of the protection afforded by mandatory provisions of the law in your jurisdiction, such as consumer protection laws in the European Union under the GDPR or other local regulations that cannot be overridden by contract, and if you are a resident of a jurisdiction with such mandatory protections, those rights will apply to you as required by law, ensuring that you are not disadvantaged by this governing law provision while using our Services. For any questions about the governing law or its implications for your use of our Services, you can contact us at privacy@casalux.com, and we will provide clarification or direct you to resources that can help you understand how these legal provisions apply to your specific situation, maintaining transparency and accessibility in our legal framework for all users worldwide.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>13. Third-Party Services</strong><br>
        Our Services may integrate with or provide access to third-party services, such as payment processors, social media platforms, or external APIs, which are not operated or controlled by us, and while we strive to partner with reputable providers, we are not responsible for the availability, functionality, accuracy, or privacy practices of these third-party services, meaning that if you interact with them—such as by using a third-party payment gateway to make a purchase, linking your account to a social media platform, or accessing external content through an embedded link—you do so at your own risk, and their terms of service, privacy policies, and practices will apply, which may differ from ours, so we strongly recommend reviewing their policies before engaging to understand how your data will be handled and what risks may be involved, such as potential data sharing or differing security standards. We do not endorse, warrant, or assume liability for any third-party services, including their content, products, or services, and any disputes or issues arising from your use of such services must be resolved directly with the third-party provider, such as if a payment fails due to an issue with the payment processor or if a social media platform misuses your data, and while we may assist in facilitating communication if needed, we will not be liable for any damages, losses, or inconveniences resulting from your interactions with these third parties, ensuring that you understand the boundaries of our responsibility and the importance of due diligence when using external services through our platform, and you can contact us at privacy@casalux.com if you need clarification on any third-party integrations or their impact on your experience with our Services.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>14. Modifications to Services</strong><br>
        We reserve the right to modify, update, suspend, or discontinue any part of our Services at any time, at our sole discretion, with or without notice, which may include adding new features, removing outdated functionalities, updating user interfaces, changing pricing structures, or temporarily halting access for scheduled maintenance, upgrades, or emergency repairs, as these changes are necessary to ensure the long-term sustainability, security, and performance of our platform, and while we will strive to minimize disruptions, we will not be liable for any inconvenience, loss of access, or data loss resulting from such modifications, such as if a feature you rely on is removed, a subscription price increases, or a temporary outage prevents you from accessing your account, as these risks are inherent in using a dynamic digital service that evolves to meet user needs and technological advancements. We may notify you of significant changes, such as the discontinuation of a core feature or a major pricing adjustment, through email, website notices, or in-app alerts, giving you the opportunity to adjust your usage or subscription accordingly, and your continued use of our Services after such modifications constitutes your acceptance of the changes, meaning if you do not agree with the updated Services, you may terminate your account as outlined in the Termination section, ensuring that you have the flexibility to opt out if the changes do not align with your needs, while we remain committed to providing a high-quality experience and keeping you informed of updates that may impact your use of our platform in any significant way.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>15. Contact Information</strong><br>
        If you have any questions, concerns, or requests regarding these Terms and Conditions, your use of our Services, or any related matters, such as inquiries about your account, billing issues, feature requests, or feedback on your experience, we encourage you to reach out to us, as we are committed to providing prompt and professional support to ensure your satisfaction and address any issues that may arise during your interaction with our platform, and you can contact us via email at privacy@casalux.com, where our dedicated support team will respond within 48 hours, or sooner if possible, unless your inquiry requires additional investigation, in which case we will keep you updated on our progress and resolution timeline, ensuring you are never left waiting without communication. Alternatively, you can visit our support page, which offers additional contact options, including a live chat feature for real-time assistance, a phone number for direct support during business hours, and a ticketing system where you can submit a detailed request and track its status, providing you with multiple channels to get in touch and ensuring that your concerns are addressed in a manner that is most convenient for you, while we also welcome general feedback or suggestions on how we can improve our Services, as we value your input and strive to continually enhance our platform to better serve our users, maintaining an open and accessible line of communication at all times.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>16. Miscellaneous</strong><br>
        These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding your use of our Services, superseding any prior agreements, understandings, or representations, whether written or oral, ensuring that all terms governing our relationship are consolidated in this document for clarity and consistency, while any failure on our part to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of such right or provision, meaning that if we do not immediately act on a violation, such as delaying the suspension of an account for minor misuse, we retain the right to enforce the Terms at a later date, preserving our ability to maintain compliance and fairness across our platform. If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid by a court or arbitrator, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect, ensuring the overall integrity of these Terms is maintained, while the headings used in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal effect, serving solely to improve readability and organization of the document. You may not assign or transfer your rights or obligations under these Terms without our prior written consent, which we may withhold at our discretion, while we may assign or transfer our rights and obligations to a third party, such as in the case of a merger or acquisition, without your consent, provided we notify you of such a transfer, ensuring that any changes in ownership do not adversely affect your rights under these Terms, and for any additional questions or clarifications about these provisions, you can reach us at privacy@casalux.com, as we are here to support you and provide the information you need to understand and comply with these Terms effectively.
      </p>
